# ATACTIC for iOS

ATACTIC is a B2B SaaS platform for field sales teams to track their goals and prospects on the go.

# Features

* Check the leads, prospects and accounts he manages, and sort them by priority (score)
* Locate those accounts on a map and calculate an optimal route based on his/her current position and priorities
* Report a visit, which is geo-located. The account visited is automatically identified based on its proximity
* Check his/her personal OKRs (Objective Key Results) / goals, the current progress and all detailed information about each of them

# Technical Info
